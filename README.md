# Would-You-Rather-Project
# About
Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree project in which I have created a bookshelf app that allows user to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

# How to Load the App
The project uses Node.js and the Create-React-App starter. If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: Node.js

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to save the app

git clone https://github.com/ihab3244/

# Installation
You can use npm or yarn package manager to install dependencies.

npm install or yarn install Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the development server with

npm start or yarn start A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser
